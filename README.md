# Plan R : Lucene Plugins
Apache Lucene and Tika plugins for Plan-R

## Apache JAR Files
This repo includes an internal version of Lucene and Tika. See
LICENSE.APACHE for distribution terms for these JAR files.

The JAR files for Lucene and Tika are in lib/java. The API for both libraries
is stable enough that these files can be replaced with a symlink to 
locally-installed JARs.

The versions include in this distribution are:
 * lucene-core-3.6.1.jar 
 * tika-app-1.12.jar
These have been renamed to lucene-core.jar and tika-app.jar, respectively.
